I've named this tool "FFSerial", as it converts your files to another format one-by-one from one folder in series, that is, not all at once, so as not to overtax your PC if your converting high-quality videos.

These scripts should run on Windows, Linux, and MacOS. setup_ffmpeg.sh creates the necessary folders, and installs ffmpeg and wget if needed. run_ffmpeg.sh converts files in "In" folder to your preferred format, which you can select, and places the converted files in "Out" folder.

The majority of the code was written by ChatGPT.

You're free to distribute, edit, and use this code in any way you like.
